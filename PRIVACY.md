# Privacy Policy

Tony Atkins <duhrer@gmail.com> develops and publishes "Free Speech for Android" (henceforth referred
to as "the app").  This page informs you about what data "the app" collects and how it is used.


# What permissions are used by the app?

1. The app makes use of the camera to create photos that can be used to label buttons, and can save these to your device.
2. The app makes use of the microphone to record custom sounds that play when a button is pressed, and can save these to your device.
3. The app can save backups of your data to zip files on your device.
3. The app can read existing files from your device.
4. The app makes use of the internet when sending crash reports. 

# How is it used?

Media files and data used by this app are only ever stored on your local device, and are never sent
to ourselves or any other third party.

When a crash occurs, you will be asked whether you want to share the bug report.  If you choose to 
submit a bug report, the developer will receive an email containing crash logs and anonymous details
about your device (manufacturer, model, Android version, et cetera).  

# Changes to this policy.

This privacy policy is effective as of February 8th, 2017, and will remain in effect until
superseded.  Updates will be published to the app's github repository.  The latest version will be 
linked from the repository home:
